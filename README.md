# Fashion-MNIST with Pytorch
Building a neural network classifier using Fashion MNIST dataset and Pytorch.

# The Background
## Original MNIST
The original MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28. MNIST is widely regarded as the "hello world" of deep learning and is often the starting place for many people who are new to deep learning to start building their first neural networks.
